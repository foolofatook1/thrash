2. Determine the amount of memory and swap size and device name on your 
computer. 

/proc/swaps:
Filename	Type		Size		Used	Priority
/dev/sda4	partition	3999740		0		-1
_____________________________________________________________

free -m:
total	used	free	shared	buff/cache	available
Mem:	7904	1381	4356    	58		2166		6124
Swap:	3905	   0	3905		
_____________________________________________________________

PAGESIZE: 4096 **in bytes**

5. If your program allocates 200 MB and you run your program twice for five
seconds, does it cause the same number of page faults? Explain. What is the
maximum memory that you can allocate in a single run of thrash without an
allocation error? Explain your findings.

No it does not. The page faults are typically relatively close to about the
same amount (off by about one or two less the second time it's run). 
This is likely because parts of the process that were needed the previous 
time it was run are now cached and therefore don't cause a page fault the 
second time it is run. I get allocation errors kind of randomly between 
5000000 MB and 5700000 MB. I'm a little confused as to why this is so high.i
I suspect it's because it's way beyond the limits of my partition, which is
3999740 MB.
